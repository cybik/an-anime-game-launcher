    Hi there! Welcome to the An Anime Game Launcher

    We need to prepare some stuff and download default components before you could run the game


tos-violation-warning = ToS violation warning

tos-violation-warning-message =
    This launcher is an unofficial tool, in no way related to {company-name} nor {company-alter-name}.

    This tool is designed to facilitate playing {game-name} on Linux, and was built with the sole purpose of installing and running the game with less hassle.

    It does so by using existing components and making the experience simple for the user.

    However, some components used here likely break the {company-name} Terms of Service for {game-name}.

    If you are using this launcher, your player account could become identified as TOS-non-compliant by {company-name}/{company-alter-name}.

    If this happens, as your account would be disobeying TOS, {company-name}/{company-alter-name} are free to do what they want. Including banning.

    If you understand the risk of trying to play the game in an unofficial capacity, press OK and let's go researching the world of Teyvat!
